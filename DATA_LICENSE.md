## Music and metadata (Jamendo / JamendoMaxCaps)

The track catalog, track metadata (titles, artists, durations), and audio referenced
in this repository are derived from the **Jamendo** platform, via the

  no-derivatives terms).

## Demo catalog (`backend/data/demo_catalog.json`)

After the event the Cyanite API was retired, and search now uses this local catalog.
It is harvested by `backend/build_catalog.py` from the **public Jamendo API** and holds
track metadata only (id, title, artist, duration, tags, licence URL). The same CC BY-SA 3.0
terms and the per-track Creative Commons licences described above apply.
**It contains no Cyanite model output.**

## Cyanite analysis

Audio analysis, tags, scores, and model outputs produced by Cyanite for these tracks
are the intellectual property of Cyanite (elceedee UG, haftungsbeschränkt) and are
governed by the Cyanite Sponsor Challenge Agreement, not by this notice.

## User profiles (pseudonymized)

The user profiles in `data/` (user identifiers and their associated liked tracks) are
**pseudonymized**: they contain numeric identifiers only, with no names, emails, or
other directly identifying information.

This data is provided solely for participation in HACKATUNE 2026. By using it you agree
to:

- process it only for the purpose of the Cyanite challenge at HACKATUNE 2026,
